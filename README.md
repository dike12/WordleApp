### **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**: Run the game and you'll be presented with a 5x5 grid. This grid represents your guesses for the hidden word.
2. **Guess the Word**: Each row in the grid corresponds to one guess. Type or click on the letters to form a 5-letter word.
3. **Get Hints**: After submitting a guess, the game will provide hints:
   - **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
   - **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but not in the correct position.
   - **Red**: The letter is not in the word.
4. **Win or Lose**: The goal is to guess the word within 5 tries. If you do, you win! If not, better luck next time.
